## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a project focused on developing a deep learning model to classify images into different yoga poses. The project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to distinguish among five yoga poses including the downward dog, goddess, tree, plank, and warrior poses.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Yoga Poses Dataset" from Kaggle. It contains images categorized into five classes representing different yoga poses. You can find the dataset from [Yoga Poses Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset/data).

## Target Audience
This Github Respository, specifically the Jupyter notebook is structured to be accessible for beginners, providing detailed explanations and a step-by-step approach, while also encompassing advanced techniques for seasoned practitioners. Let's dive into the world of Yoga Pose Detection and deep learning!
